# Bachelor thesis and project

As I was starting the final year at Mendel University in Brno I got an interesting offer. The offer was to take part in [Smart Migration project](https://chytramigrace.cz/index.php/smart-migration/). It was an offer I could not reject. In fact as it turned out it ended up being my way into the mobile app development. The task was to recreate already existing app for Android platform to iOS version. The would display different topics and solutions to related problems, migrants can face while dealing with them. App also features chatbot, which was so much fun making. The app itself was my first big project, but ended up great.

After submiting the project to the defense I got graded A by my supervisor and A by the oponent.
